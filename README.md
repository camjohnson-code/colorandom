# colorandom

Welcome to Colorandom, a simple web app that generates random color palettes for your creative projects. This project allows you to explore and save unique color combinations effortlessly. The design and rubric was assigned to me as part of a group project at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/colorandom.html). After completing it with the group, however, I decided to go through and tackle this on my own.

## Features
Dynamic Color Generation: Click the "NEW PALETTE" button to generate a new set of random colors.
Palette Locking: Click on the lock icon to keep a color in place while generating new ones.
Save Your Palettes: Press the "SAVE PALETTE" button to store your favorite color combinations.
View and Edit Saved Palettes: See your saved palettes on the right side, and click on them to restore and edit.

### How to Use
Click the "NEW PALETTE" button to generate a new set of colors.
Lock individual colors by clicking on the lock icon.
Save your favorite palettes using the "SAVE PALETTE" button.
View and edit your saved palettes on the right side. By clicking on a saved palette, you can reload it in the main section.

### Future Features

There are several feature I'd like to add moving forward. These include:

- Ensuring that all saved palettes are unique.
- When a user tries to delete a saved palette, have them confirm that they really do want to delete it.
- ~~Implement localStorage so the saved palettes persist on page load.~~
- Allow users to name their palettes when saving.
- Allow users to name their palettes when saving, and allow them to search their saved palettes by name.
- Create a way for users to adjust a color.
- Figure out how to programmatically generate random palettes that are cohesive and pleasant.
